# ML-controllers-with-memory-for-robust-quadrotor-control-and-research

This project reposity is for for all code and data developed during my thesis project, along with the produced thesis and thesis presentation. The content is seperated into three directories. 
<br/><br/><br/>


## Crazyflie_Firmware_Direct_Control

This directory contains updated firmware for the crazyflie 2.X quadrotors to be able to control the motors individually by sending setpoint command packets over the crazyflie radio.
<br/><br/><br/>

## Real

This Directory contains all of the code reqiured to fly the crazyflie 2.x using the VICON motion capture system and crazyrado. It is built in such a way that it should be realatively easy to modify and add different controllers or systems. This directory does not contain the nessecary modifications to the crazyflie library for direct control, that is found in **Crazyflie_Firmware_Direct_Control**<br/><br/><br/>

## Simulation

This directory contains all of the code used to train different models in order to control quadrotors
