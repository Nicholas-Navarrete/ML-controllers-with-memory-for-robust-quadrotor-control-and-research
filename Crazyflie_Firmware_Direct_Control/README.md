# Crazyflie_Firmware_Direct_Control
This directory contains the updated firmware to fly the crazyflie 2.x using by remotely controlling the motors directly. The send_setpoint commands are sent as 4 uint32 instead of 3 floats and 1 uint32 these values are then written directly to the motors with some battery compensation. To flash this code to the crazyflie 2.x follow the default flashing instructions for the crazyflie, I did this over the radio and I had to use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) in visual studio. In order to take advantage of this firmware you also need to modify the controller.py file in the crazyflie library as described in the README of the ***Real*** directory of this repository. The actual firmware in the subdirectory ***crazyflie-firmware*** includes the original readme of the firmware.
